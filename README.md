# Exercise-Workflows-and-FAIR-principles
This repository is created to complete the first exercise of BERN02, which is focusing on workflows and FAIR principles.

## Tasks
In this exercise, the tasks below should be completed.
- Set up a reproducible workflow containing at least the following:
    - Descriptive text and explanations, e.g. markdown. This should detail how others can use and run your workflow. Specify requirements. Equations using LaTeX math are encouraged.
    - Code cells, *e.g.* Python, R, or some other language.
    - Output cells with *e.g.* figures, tables, and/or other elements.
- For your particular setup, specify dependencies and version pinning. For conda this would e.g. be an ***environment.yml*** file, but it depends on the system you are using. Motivate your choice of version pinning and add a risk assessment for future package breaking.
- Place your workflow on a repository, e.g. github, gitlab or elsewhere. Add as much relevant metadata as possible in the form of keywords, license, README etc.
- In the notebook, add a section where you discuss how your workflow relates to FAIR data principles.

## Contents
The contents here are from one process of getting numerical solutions of shallow water equation. Its detail and its achievements are listed in the Jupyter notebook contained in the repository.

The requirement for packages are stored in the [environment.txt](environment.txt).  These packages are used to complete my previous week assignment. 

Since this project was dealing with equations, there were no data to be processed in the project.
